## 1. Problem

- Brazil's biomethane mandate (Lei 14.993/2024, Combustível do Futuro) set a 1 % base for 2026; **CNPE cut it to 0.5 %** (Res. 4/2026) citing insufficient supply.
- Installed capacity is growing (~21 plants, ~1.37 million Nm³/d nationally in Jul 2026), but **actual output lags nameplate**: SP mill-based plants show capacity factors of **0–58 %**, with strong **off-season collapse** (ANP monthly data).
- São Paulo has the country's largest sugarcane residue base (vinasse, filter cake, straw) plus livestock and urban residues, but sugarcane residues are **seasonal (≈ April–November)**.
- There is no open, calibrated, spatially explicit tool that answers **cost, viability and location** jointly with **seasonality** for SP.

## 2. Research questions

1. **Supply:** How much vinasse, filter cake, straw and manure is available per mill catchment, per month, 2008–2025, with uncertainty?
2. **Process:** Which year-round co-digestion strategies (stored filter cake, manure base-load, other residues, shutdown/restart) keep a CSTR within safe operating limits, and what capacity factor do they reach?
3. **Economics:** What is the levelized cost of biomethane (LCOB) per site and strategy, and which revenue stack (gas, CGOB, CBIO, digestate) makes it viable?
4. **Siting:** Where should plants be located, at what scale, connected how (grid injection vs CNG/LNG trucking)?
5. **Policy:** What SP biomethane supply curve results, and what does it imply for the 0.5 %→1 %→10 % mandate path?

Hypotheses are in `docs/02_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS_AND_HYPOTHESES.md`.

## 5. Approach (one paragraph)

Public data (MapBiomas, IBGE/SEADE, ANP, RenovaBio certification reports, UNICA, infrastructure layers) is harmonized on an H3 grid. A **spatial interaction (Huff) model** allocates cane to mills and is **calibrated on mill-level RenovaBio data**; residues follow engineering coefficients and a monthly harvest profile. A **CSTR mass balance with operating constraints** converts substrate mixes into methane month by month. An **economics module** with a **hierarchical Bayesian CAPEX model** (Brazilian projects + international priors) computes LCOB and viability under Monte Carlo uncertainty. A **multi-period MILP** chooses sites, scales and logistics. The whole chain is **calibrated against ANP monthly plant output** (e.g. Raízen Costa Pinto, Cocal Narandiba) before scenarios are run.

| Phase | Weeks | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Foundation & verification | 1–3 | Repo, environment, verified registry, LAI requests filed |

## 8. Success criteria

- ≥ 80 % of parameters used in results flagged **V**.
- Supply model reproduces RenovaBio mill-level cane within a stated error (target MAPE < 15 % on held-out mills).
- Process+economics chain reproduces observed monthly utilization pattern of ≥ 2 SP mill plants.
- Every number in a paper is traceable to `registry/` via `source_id`.
